# Overview
Hello, I am Michael Disieno and this is my submission for the LightFeather Backend Engineer Coding Challenge

# To test the get call
Please go to the respective ip/url the host machine provides with the respective port provided in the console. 
Please append either "/api/getSupervisors" or /api/postSupervisors" to the end. If you forget, the base url will remind you.

Example:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/getSupervisors
http://192.168.5.300:5000/api/postSupervisors
```

# Running with docker-compose
```
docker-compose up --build
